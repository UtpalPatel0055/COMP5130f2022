Work by me (for Week 4):
        I have developed two new models: Candidate and question with controller as well. For this have create, find and delete end points. Also, as I have worked upon JWT last week, so I have made invitation mail functionality. For security purpose, to avoid cross origin request, I have added JWT authorization token in header of the request which is required to hit the api. Without this token, it will give unauthorized user exception. When the owner of the assessment will enter the candidate list for that assessment, an automated email will be sent to the candidate where the candidate gets a web link to start the assessment. Moreover, I with my teammate, connected backend with front end (React.js) which was little hard as we got so many connection and HTTP status errors. Here, I have one file which specify custom HTTP status code declared by me. I also helped to design Assessment view page.
