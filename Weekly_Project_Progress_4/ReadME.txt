Work by me (for Week 4):
        I have developed two new modules: Candidate and question with controller as well. Both this have create, find and delete end points. Also, as I have worked upon JWT last week, so I have made invitation mail functionality. When the owner of the assessment will enter the candidate list for that assessment, an automated email will be sent to the candidate where the candidate gets a web link to start the assessment. Moreover, I with my teammate, connected backend with front end (React.js) which was little hard as we got so many connection and HTTP status errors. I also helped to make Assessment view page.
