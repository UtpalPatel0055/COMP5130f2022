Work by me (for Week 5):
    Now, assessment are create and while creating assessment, it can also be updated while creating and multiple question can be added. In addition now I can add a candidate for a specific assessment and this will send a email with jwt  token by clicking on it, first, it will ask to enable camera, microphone. For testing it will be hidden. Also images are stored in cloudinary when you take first image , and every second 4 second image will be caputre from video and send to cloudinary. And also all questions for that candiate are visible according to  question type. Just submit button is remain in this scenario. Also added rating for app while submitting.
