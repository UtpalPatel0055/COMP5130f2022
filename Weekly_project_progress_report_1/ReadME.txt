Work by me (for Week 1): 
    I started creating Login page using Java Framework called Spring boot and JPA. I have implemented Model-View-Controller design here, where my controller will get the data from a login page form and check the credential (username and password) whether they exist in database or not. If they do, the controller will allow the user to enter into the system (welcome.jsp page).
