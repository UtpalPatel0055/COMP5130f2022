Work by me (for Week 3):
  I have implemented two major functionalities for week 3. First, I defined a set of controller for User, Team and Assessment where I have defined certain end points which works with JSON format as our Front end is in React.js so we will connect backend and frontend using JSON string. Last week, I have developed Models with certain Column name defined but I have added some more required column names and made API end points that basically uses Model to perform CRUD operation. Here, I am using JWT (JSON Web Token) for authorization.
  Second functionality is email function. I have developed this functionality using Flask Mail API. I have used gmail host send an email to new users with verification link inside the emails. I tried to use Google Mail API service but I was getting so many errors so I shifted to Flask Mail API. I am using Postman workspace to check my custom APIs.
